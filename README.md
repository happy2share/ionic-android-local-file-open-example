# ionic-android-local-file-open-example
This is an example for opening a local pdf file in ionic android platform.
For opening a file in assets folder, we need to copy the file to device sd card first.
For acheiving that I used File Plugin (http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/file/)
And used File Opener 2 Plugin (http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/fileOpener2/) to open the respective file once it is copied to SD Card.
Hope it helps someone !!!
